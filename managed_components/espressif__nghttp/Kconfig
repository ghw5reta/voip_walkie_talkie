            Set the size of the inbound buffer for nghttp2. This buffer is used to store incoming HTTP/2 frames.
            The default value is 16KB as per nghttp2 library configuration but here we have set it to 4KB. The
            receive buffer gets placed on the stack and hence adjust this value based on your application needs
            and available stack size.
